# WindowsPostSetupAssistant
GUI to easily create and save automated configuration/app install profiles that can quickly be applied to fresh installations of Windows. 

Everything you need to set up your workstation the way you want it (Almost completely automatically) after installing Windows!

# Objectives
You should be able to install Windows 10 or 11 and then:

As soon as you finish setup and get to a desktop with internet, you should be able to run the main batch file as Admin and:

* Select a profile that you created previously using this application
* Answer questions for anything you've marked optional all at the beginning

* Let it run (It will handle rebooting as necessary.)

* When it's finished, with no interaction on your part after the initial prompts, you should have:
    * Windows completely up-to-date, if desired
    * Any applications you want, installed
    * Your workstation almost completely configured:
        * Windows settings changed to match your chosen settings
        * Application settings changed to match your chosen settings
