# Windows Post-Setup Assistant
GUI to easily create and save automated configuration/app install profiles that can quickly be applied to fresh installations of Windows. 

Everything you need to set up your workstation the way you want it (Almost completely automatically) after installing Windows!

# Prerequisites
* A Windows 10 or Windows 11 Installation that is not configured with your preferred settings or applications.

* Internet on said machine

# Objectives 
## Profile Creation
* Profiles should be able to install applications and configure windows/app settings in a predefined order

* Any application installation should be able to be marked as optional, which will prompt the user at runtime asking if they want to install it

* Any setting change should be able to be marked as optional, which will prompt the user at runtime asking if they want to make that change

* All prompts should happen as early as possible after running the main batch file so that for the majority of the time necessary, user interaction is not required

## Automatic Profile Execution
You should be able to run the main batch file as Admin and:

* Select a profile that you created previously using this application
* Answer prompts for anything you've marked optional all at the beginning

* Let it run (It will handle rebooting as necessary.)

* When it's finished, with no interaction on your part after the initial prompts, you should have:
    * Windows completely up-to-date, if desired
    * Any applications you want, installed
    * Your workstation almost completely configured:
        * Windows settings changed to match your chosen settings
        * Application settings changed to match your chosen settings
