# WindowsPostSetupAssistant
GUI to easily create and save configuration/app install profiles that can quickly be applied to fresh installations of Windows. Everything you need to set up your workstation the way you want it after installing Windows!

# Objectives
You should be able to install Windows 10 or 11 and then:

As soon as you finish setup and get to a desktop, you should be able to run the main batch file as Admin and:

* Select a profile that you created previously using this application
* Answer questions for anything you've marked optional all at the beginning

* Let it run (It will handle rebooting and resuming as necessary.)

* When it's finished, with no interaction on your part after the initial prompts stage, you should have:
    * Windows completely up-to-date, if desired
    * All applications you want, installed
    * Your workstation almost completely configured:
        * All Windows settings changed to match your chosen settings
        * All application settings changed to match your chosen settings
